# Vanilla Interpretation Castles Applied
This castle set, created by Krarilotus, aims to replace the Vanilla Castles while remaining largely faithful to their original designs and technologies. However, each castle features an optimized build order, enhanced production capabilities, and improved pathfinding to boost economic efficiency. Certain AI configurations receive additional production chains, such as beer, bread, or weapons manufacturing.

Designed to complement the first and second vanilla skirmish trails, these castles are particularly suited for the second trail when played in conjunction with the Vanilla Retraced Project. They offer robust defense capabilities and efficient resource utilization in their construction. While compatible with most AI behavior plugins, it is recommended to use them with either the Aggressive AI by Krarilotus or the Apex AI by Xander10alpha for the best experience.

This Plugin applied all castles to their respective AIs in vanilla order.
